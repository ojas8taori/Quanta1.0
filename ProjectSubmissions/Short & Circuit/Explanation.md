# How It Works

## Quantum Circuit Creation:

Uses a 4-qubit quantum circuit.
Applies Hadamard (H) gates to each qubit, creating equal superpositions (random outcomes).
Measures the qubits to obtain random binary values.

## Random Number Generation:

Runs the quantum circuit using a quantum simulator.
Converts the measured bitstrings to integers.

## Random Bits & Integer Generation:

Generates a string of random bits.
Uses these bits to create random integers within a given range.

## Visualization:

Runs multiple simulations to plot a histogram of the distribution of generated numbers.
