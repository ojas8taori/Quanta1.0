Quantum Coin Flip Simulation

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that simulates a quantum coin flip using Qiskit. The simulation leverages quantum superposition to demonstrate how a qubit can be in a state of both heads and tails until measured.

Features

#Uses Qiskit to create and manipulate quantum circuits

#Simulates a quantum coin flip using Hadamard gates

#Uses Qiskit Aer to run the quantum circuit on a simulator

#Visualizes results using Qiskit tools
